# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to the maintainers via email or a private GitHub security advisory.

**Do not file public issues for security vulnerabilities.**

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of the registry schema and tools are currently supported.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Tool Security

This registry contains metadata for tools. We perform basic validation but cannot guarantee the security of the tools themselves (hosted in external repositories). Users rely on these tools at their own risk.
